      <h1>RNS and its Attempt to Help with Seizures</h1>

      <p>
        When a seizure occurs, there are bursts of electrical activity in your
        brain. This activity causes different symptoms depending on the type of
        seizure and what part of the brain is involved. Seizures can take on
        many different forms, affecting people in different ways. Anything that
        your brain is capable of, applies the same during a seizure. For
        example, your brain helps you move, see, feel and do many other things.
        Those same functions fully apply during a seizure as well, voluntarily
        or involuntarily. Also, in some seizures, parts of the brain can still
        function normally while others can’t. Seizures have a beginning, middle,
        and end, but sometimes not all the parts of a seizure are visible or
        easy to tell apart. It’s possible you won’t have every stage or symptom,
        but if you have more than one seizure, you may notice that your seizures
        are very similar or can repeat in a similar fashion. Seizures are
        complex, they come and go, some you’re possibly able to anticipate while
        others are sudden.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those that can be anticipated allow for the person having a seizure
        better prepare so nothing dangerous occurs, an early sign of a seizure
        is called a prodrome. These feelings are usually not part of the
        seizure, but they serve as a warning sign that a seizure may come, if
        you were a person that has these signs you can take steps to stay safe
        and position yourself in a safer area. Some people have an “aura,” or
        warning. This is the first symptom of a seizure. It’s considered part of
        the seizure, since bursts of electrical activity have already initiated
        in the brain when this occurs. During this part of the seizure, you are
        still conscious and aware of what is going on. An aura is often a change
        in feeling, sensation, thought, or behavior. If you have more than one
        seizure, you may have a similar aura each time. Some don't experience or
        sense the aura or warning. When they have a seizure, they lose
        consciousness or awareness immediately. Typically, an aura happens
        before the main part of a seizure. The aura can occur as an isolated
        incident, without any other symptoms. Those are defined as a simple
        partial seizure.
      </p>

      <p>
        A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal
        seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of your
        brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading
        through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals
        being sent to your muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these
        signals in your brain can make you lose consciousness and have severe
        muscle contractions.
